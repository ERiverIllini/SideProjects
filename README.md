# SideProjects
Collection of some of the projects/code I had been working that were generally to small or non-collaborative and thus didn't really warrant their own repo.

Examples included:
Movies and Password are both android. They're pretty small and were just made for getting more acclimated with Android. GoFish isn't an Android project, but it is an example of something relatively more complicated I've done. READMEs are available in each individual folder that explains each project a little more indepth.
